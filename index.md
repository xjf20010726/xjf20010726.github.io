Here is **Junfan Xue (ËñõÈíßËó©)**.
I am now studying for a master's degree in the School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing. I am studying for a master's degree in Polarization-SAR Remote Sensing Application Laboratory under the guidance of Professor [Professor Junjun Yin](https://scce.ustb.edu.cn/shiziduiwu/jiaoshixinxi/2018-04-14/112.html).

My research direction is polarized synthetic aperture radar ship detection and segmentation. My research interests include computer Vision, Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer. 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *M202310688@xs.ustb.edu.cn*.

## Academic Background

- **Sep 2023 - June 2026:** University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing. 
- **Sep 2019 - June 2023:** University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing. 

I hope I can apply for a doctoral degree in the second year of postgraduate study.
